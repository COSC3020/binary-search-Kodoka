# Binary Search

Implement a binary search function that, given a sorted list and an element to
look for, returns the index of the element in the list or -1 if the element is
not there.

Use the template in `code.js`. The tests in `code.test.js` will be run
automatically every time you push to Github; if they pass you are done.

# Chance's Comments

I have not been feeling well, and don't know what I was thinking with my earlier submissions.

I utilized the following sources:

https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_loop_for.asp - As a refresher on how to format for loops in javascript.

https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/binary-search/ - As a refresher on how a binary search algorithm works.

Though not explicitly related to the assignment, I did a brief read through of
https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsverify to install the jsverify module, and get a rough idea of what it
does, so I could test locally, instead of pushing to git with every change I thought would make a
difference.

Updating for that ESLint fella.

I certify that I have listed all sources used to complete this exercise, including the use of any Large Language Models. All of the work is my own, except where stated otherwise. I am aware that plagiarism carries severe penalties and that if plagiarism is suspected, charges may be filed against me without prior notice.
